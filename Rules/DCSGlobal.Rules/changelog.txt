3-30-2017   addded 	_TotalRulesToFire   so the modrules know in advance how many rules to proceess
					added code to the get tankbyid to handle no tank rows
					add code so that on no rules it will build tank
					added code so that when Run_rules or Run_avs is null is forced to N	
					addec doe so that if RUNRULES is N it will get out and clean up

					1 . if  usp_get_all_data_tank_ByID retruns 0 rows call usp_rules_non_processed_rows with ID and sPatHospitalCode get out i am done
 					2. if usp_get_all_data_tank_ByID returns rows but there are no rules write the dummy rule and get out
 					3. if run_rules ='N' get out and do nothing
